                <li>Utilized K-Means, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to create organized clusters from unlabeled data by identifying centroids for pixel colors in an image.</li>
                <li> Leveraged MATLAB's capability to load PNG and JPG images as matrices representing RGB concentrations pixel-wise, treating each pixel as an unlabeled data point.</li>
                <li>Configured the parameter K to reduce the number of colors in the image to 16, enhancing representation efficiency by clustering similar pixel colors into defined groups. </li>
                <li>Initialized centroids multiple times to avoid poor local minima, computed effective clusters, and used the resulting 16 colors to recreate the original image with reduced color complexity.</li>
